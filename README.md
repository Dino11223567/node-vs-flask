# node-vs-flask
Quick comaprison of a basic node application vs. a basic flask application.


## Why
I've developed a number of different Flask apps in the last year. When I started learning JS and Python, I ended up
going down the rabbit hole of Flask...and haven't ever really wanted to go back. That being said, after being "snowed-in"
for three days, I decided to wall myself off in the home-office and revisit Node. This repo is the product of comparing the
two while my dog looked painfully bored.

## Usage
This was purely meant for my own edification. However, I hope it can help others that are looking to make the jump one way or
the other. I've commented out the similarities - in my mind - on the server file for the Node app.

## Running the Node server
You can find how to set up the Node server below.

## Comments/Issues
I'd love to make this collaborative. If I've completely screwed something up, or you see something that I don't, let me know!
